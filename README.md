# Colors stats

Tool finds all colors in CSS/JS and shows it on one page with usage stats & files urls by hover

1. Place it to your project
2. Rename `config-example` to `config` and fill it with the actual data
3. Run `node YOUR_PATH/colorsStats/index.js`
4. Open in browser generated `index.html` (you will find it in `colorsStats` folder)

Tool can optionally:

* ignore files and directories
* filter files by date
* parse only given urls

See `config-example.json` for more information
